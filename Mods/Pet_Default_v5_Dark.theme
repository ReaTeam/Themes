@about
  This is my dark version of the v5 default theme. It has the same functionality as the original theme and includes all layouts. The colors you choose for your tracks are more visible. If you want it pastel-colored or saturated colors, it looks more like you've chosen it . But its overall appearance is dark.

  There are some differences I want to mention:

  This has changed:
  - if you use the "Dual Pan"-Mode, the color of the right channel is red, the left channel is blue, according to the other pan colors
  - the Transport Play/Pause buttons: if stopped, they are "unlit", if on/pause is active, they are "lit"
  - the meters are 3-color-style (green/yellow/red)

  This has been added:
  - a layout named "Standard bottom" for the Transport Bar, which can be useful when you have the Transport Bar docked at the bottom of the main window. This layout adds a little space below the Play Buttons.
  - a drum toolbar button for the MIDI Editor. If you use the "Named Notes Mode" for drums and want a drum icon there, you can take this one. There's actually a drum icon in the default theme, but in the MIDI Editor there is now a nice frame around these four Mode-Icons. I added this frame to that toolbar icon.
