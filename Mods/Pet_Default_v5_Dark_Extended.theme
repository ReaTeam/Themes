@about
  This is the extended version of my Default 5 Dark Theme, a darker version of the original default theme. It has more layouts, at the moment only separators, but I'm working on some more. (see the thread in the forum)

  There are some differences I want to mention:

  This has changed:
  - if you use the "Dual Pan"-Mode, the color of the right channel is red, the left channel is blue, according to the other pan colors
  - the Transport Play/Pause buttons: if stopped, they are "unlit", if on/pause is active, they are "lit"
  - the meters are 3-color-style (green/yellow/red)

  This has been added:
  - a layout named "Standard bottom" for the Transport Bar, which can be useful when you have the Transport Bar docked at the bottom of the main window. This layout adds a little space below the Play Buttons.
  - a drum toolbar button for the MIDI Editor. If you use the "Named Notes Mode" for drums and want a drum icon there, you can take this one. There's actually a drum icon in the default theme, but in the MIDI Editor there is now a nice frame around these four Mode-Icons. I added this frame to that toolbar icon.
